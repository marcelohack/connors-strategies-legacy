## FibonacciDivergence


### Overview
This strategy, named FibonacciDivergence, leverages the confluence of technical indicators to identify high-probability reversal or continuation trades. It focuses on spotting divergences between the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and price action specifically when the price is retracing to a key Fibonacci level. Trades are entered in the direction of the detected divergence (bullish or bearish), emphasizing mean-reversion or momentum shifts at support/resistance zones defined by Fibonacci retracements. Exits are managed using volatility-based targets derived from Average True Range (ATR) multiples, promoting disciplined risk-reward ratios. The strategy is suitable for trending markets on timeframes like 1H, 4H, or daily charts, where Fibonacci levels act as dynamic filters to reduce false signals.

### Key Strategy Components
1. **RSI Divergence Detection**: The core signal generator. Divergence occurs when price makes a new high/low, but RSI fails to confirm it (e.g., price higher high with RSI lower high for bearish divergence, or vice versa for bullish). This indicates weakening momentum and potential reversal.
2. **Fibonacci Retracement Filter**: Price must be at a significant Fibonacci retracement level (typically 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) of the prior swing high/low. This acts as a confluence zone, confirming the divergence's validity by aligning it with natural support/resistance.
3. **ATR for Exits**: Volatility measure to set dynamic profit targets and stops, ensuring exits adapt to market conditions rather than fixed percentages.
4. **Market Context**: Best applied in the direction of the overall trend (e.g., use bullish divergence in uptrends). Avoid choppy or ranging markets where divergences are less reliable.

### Required Indicators
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Period 14 (standard). Use on the same timeframe as price chart. Look for divergences visually or via oscillator plots.
- **Fibonacci Retracement Tool**: Manually drawn from the most recent swing high to swing low (or vice versa) to identify retracement levels. Key levels: 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%. No specific oscillator needed; this is a drawing tool in most platforms like TradingView or MT4.
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: Period 14. Used for calculating exit distances (e.g., 2x ATR for targets, 1x ATR for stops).
- **Optional Confirmation**: A simple moving average (e.g., 200-period SMA) to confirm trend direction, ensuring trades align with the broader market bias.

### Entry Rules
1. **Identify the Trend and Swing**: Determine the primary trend (uptrend for long bias, downtrend for short). Identify the anchor swing: from recent swing low to high (uptrend) or high to low (downtrend).
2. **Draw Fibonacci Levels**: Apply the Fibonacci retracement tool to the swing. Wait for price to pull back and touch or closely approach a key level (38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%) with a wick or body close.
3. **Spot RSI Divergence**:
   - **Bullish Divergence (Long Entry)**: Price makes a lower low at the Fib level, but RSI makes a higher low. Enter long if price closes above the Fib level or shows bullish confirmation (e.g., candlestick reversal like hammer).
   - **Bearish Divergence (Short Entry)**: Price makes a higher high at the Fib level, but RSI makes a lower high. Enter short if price closes below the Fib level or shows bearish confirmation (e.g., shooting star).
4. **Entry Trigger**: Enter on the close of the confirmation candle after divergence and Fib touch. Position size: Risk no more than 1-2% of account per trade.
5. **Filters to Avoid Entries**:
   - No entry if divergence is not clear (e.g., RSI within 20-80 neutral zone without extremes).
   - Skip if price overshoots Fib levels significantly (>5% beyond).
   - Require volume increase or candlestick confirmation for higher conviction.

### Exit Rules
1. **Profit Targets**: Use ATR multiples for dynamic scaling.
   - Primary Target: 2x ATR from entry price (e.g., for long: entry + 2*ATR).
   - Secondary Target (Partial Exit): Scale out 50% of position at 1.5x ATR, let the rest run to 3x ATR if momentum continues.
   - Trail stops: After hitting 1x ATR profit, move stop to breakeven + 0.5x ATR.
2. **Stop Loss**: Place initial stop at 1x ATR beyond the Fib level or recent swing extreme (whichever is tighter). For longs: below the Fib low; for shorts: above the Fib high. This caps risk at ~1-2% per trade.
3. **Time-Based or Reversal Exit**: If no target hit within 5-10 bars (depending on timeframe), exit to avoid stagnation. Exit early if opposite divergence forms or price breaks the next Fib extension level (e.g., 127.2%).

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Calculate based on stop distance. Risk = (Account Balance * 1-2%) / (Entry - Stop Distance). Never risk more than 2% on a single trade; max 5% total open risk.
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Aim for at least 1:2 (stop at 1x ATR, target at 2x ATR), ensuring positive expectancy over multiple trades.
- **Trade Frequency and Drawdown Control**: Limit to 1-2 open trades at a time. Pause trading after 3 consecutive losses or if drawdown exceeds 5%. Backtest on historical data to validate (e.g., win rate ~40-60% with strong R:R).
- **Market Conditions**: Avoid high-impact news events (e.g., NFP) as they can invalidate Fib levels. Use in liquid assets like forex majors (EUR/USD), indices (SPX), or stocks with clear trends.
- **Psychological Notes**: Journal trades to track divergence quality at Fib levels. This strategy's edge comes from confluence, so patience is key—wait for all conditions to align to minimize whipsaws.

This strategy emphasizes precision through multi-indicator confluence, making it more robust than standalone RSI divergence trading. Implement on a demo account first to fine-tune parameters like RSI period or ATR multiples based on the asset.
